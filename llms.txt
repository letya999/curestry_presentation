# Curestry - AgentOps Platform
# Last Updated: January 15, 2025

## About

Curestry is an on-premise AgentOps platform for debugging, monitoring, and optimizing AI agent systems in production.

Combines observability, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and automatic optimization in a single solution.

## Core Features

- Real-time observability and telemetry collection from LLM frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen)

- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) - finds why AI agents fail

- AutoFix - automatically generates and tests improved prompts

- A/B testing on real production data

- On-premise deployment with zero external APIs

- Local models support (vLLM)

- Git integration

- Slack/PagerDuty/Jira alerts

## Key Problems Solved

1. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) - from 4-8 hours to ~1 hour

2. LLM token cost reduction - 15-20% savings per month
